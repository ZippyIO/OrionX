# OrionX
OrionX Game Engine, built MonoGame.

OrionX is a game engine for my personal student projects, OrionX has been in planning for about a month, currently it has had multiple iterations, I intend to open source the project for anyone to use.

This project is currently being developed solely by myself, if you'd like to contribute feel free to! I have no timeline for this project and will be working on it as I see fit.
